# Student-performance.dataset--FE
Analyzed the StudentsPerformance dataset to predict whether students completed the test preparation course. We preprocessed data by encoding categorical features and scaling scores, selected key features, and built classification models to evaluate performance, achieving insights into influential factors.

# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Classifier

Welcome to my Student Performance Prediction project!  
This notebook uses machine learning to predict whether a student has completed a test preparation course based on their demographics and exam scores.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s inside?

- Data loading and exploration with **pandas**  
- Preprocessing with **OneHotEncoding** & **MinMax Scaling**  
- Feature selection using **SelectKBest (Chi-Square test)**  
- Model training with a **Random Forest Classifier**  


---

## ðŸš€ How to run?

1. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).  
2. Run all cells step-by-step.   
3. Feel free to tweak hyperparameters and preprocessing!

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Try different classifiers like **XGBoost** or **SVM** for better accuracy  
- Use **cross-validation** for more robust model evaluation  
- Perform **feature engineering** to create new meaningful features  
- Handle class imbalance with techniques like **SMOTE**  
- Optimize hyperparameters with **GridSearchCV** or **RandomizedSearchCV**
